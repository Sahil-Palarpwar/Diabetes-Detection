# Diabetes-Detection
Consists of diabetes detection using Gradient Boosting algorithm with a fully functional GUI. This project is a machine learning demonstration of a detection problem statement where data of various patients having diabetes or not has been used. The model works fine with a good accuracy of 88.2%, hence providing a good estimate of whether the data provided would be a diabetic human being or not.
Standard Prima dataset has been used which is universally accepted for Machine Learning problem statements.
